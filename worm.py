worm.py - an implementation of a worm, for academic purposes for course
INFO3155 Information Assurance and Security at UWI, Dept. of Computing.
This file is either to be used on a system with a Python environment, or
made into a standalone executable. It should ideally loaded onto a target
and executed somehow. When main() runs it should perform 3 basic tasks:
monitor and sendback resource usage of target system to some remote system,
replication, and propagation. We should be able to disable the replication/
propagation functions both at build and in use. We should also have a
reliable method of stopping the program at any time.
